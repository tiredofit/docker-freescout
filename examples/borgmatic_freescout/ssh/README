1. Create ssh keys without! password

server> ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
cb:3c:a0:39:69:39:ec:35:d5:66:f3:c5:92:99:2f:e1 root@server
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+

|    X o =   E .  |
|   o + . .   .   |

2. Upload ssh public key to your backup server

Alternate 1:
server> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -p22 to-your-backup-serverc.com: install-ssh-key
to-your-backup-server's password:
Key No. 1 (ssh-rsa user@host) was installed in RFC4716 format
Key No. 1 (ssh-rsa user@host) was installed in OpenSSH for

Alternate 2:
ssh-copy-id -p 22 -s to-your-backup-server.com

Alternate 3:
ssh -p 23 to-your-backup-serverc.com mkdir .ssh
scp -P 23 .ssh/id_rsa.pub to-your-backup-serverc.com:.ssh/authorized_keys

3. Test your connection and it should login without asking for password:
ssh to-your-backup-serverc.com

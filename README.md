## Prerequisites and Assumptions
*  Assumes you are using some sort of SSL terminating reverse proxy such as:
   *  [Traefik](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-traefik)
   *  [Nginx](https://github.com/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager)
   *  [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)
*  Requires access to a MySQL/MariaDB or Postgres Server

## Installation

### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/freescout)

```bash
docker pull docker.io/tiredofit/freescout:(imagetag)
```

Builds of the image are also available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-freescout/pkgs/container/docker-freescout)

```
docker pull ghcr.io/tiredofit/docker-freescout:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Container OS | Tag       |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Alpine       | `:latest` |

## Configuration

### Quick Start

- The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

- Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
- Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
- Make [networking ports](#networking) available for public access if necessary

**The first boot can take from 2 minutes - 5 minutes depending on your CPU to setup the proper schemas.**

- Login to the web server and enter in your admin email address, admin password and start configuring the system!

### Persistent Storage
The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory                | Description                                                                                                              |

| `/assets/custom`         | (Optional) Copy source code over existing source code in /www/html upon container start. Use exact file/folder structure |

| `/assets/modules`        | (Optional) If you want to add additional modules outside of the source tree, add them here                               |
| `/www/html`              | (Optional) If you want to expose the Freescout sourcecode and enable Self Updating, expose this volume                   |
| *OR*                     |                                                                                                                          |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) or [Debian Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/debian) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`,`nano`.
